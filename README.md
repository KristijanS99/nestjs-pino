<h1 align="center">NestJS-Pino with OTEL support</h1>

This is a fork of the original NestJS-Pino with one small addition to add OTEL support by attaching
logs to traces. <br>
This module is meant for internal use in my own applications and as such no support 
for it will be provided, feel free to use as is.

Check original Documentation for usage, and check `example` folder for updated example with injection of 
`getActiveSpan` using OpenTelemetry.
